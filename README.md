I wanted to see if there was a correlation between military spending and a low freedom score for post-Soviet countries. I also wanted to see how each country relates to the others on both values and if there are clustered behaviors when viewed from this angle. Read about it [here](https://medium.com/@animichelle/mapping-ex-ussr-nations-to-find-clustered-behaviors-cd113d8aa57b) and [see my code](https://github.com/animichelle/USSR-Military-Spend-vs.-Human-Freedom) .
