>>Mapping Ex-USSR Nations to find Clustered Behaviors*

I wanted to see if there was a correlation between military spending and a low freedom score for post-Soviet countries. I also wanted to see how each country relates to the others on both values and if there are clustered behaviors in the list when viewed from this angle. 

Background:
After the collapse of the USSR, its component states formed governments and economic infrastructure that ranged in the political spectrum and provided varying levels of freedom. 

To gain insight into the geopolitical nuances of the region, I’ve mapped out the countries by their military expenditure and their Human Freedom Index. The Human Freedom Index presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom. [1] Military expenditure is a percentage of GDP for the post-Soviet nations in 2017. [2] A Freedom-Military Spend quadrant best shows where each country is positioned and a correlation plot highlights if there are any trends particular to each quadrant.

Quadrant Analysis: 
I) This quadrant is characterized by high human freedom and low military spend. In it are Georgia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, which are all countries that have disassociated from the Soviet block and have aligned themselves with the European Union. Their clustered location on the quadrant is explained well by their similar economic behaviors. 

II) Armenia, a small country with military conflicts but a growing economy, stands alone in the high freedom-high military spend quadrant.

III) Together with Armenia, these quadrants contain the highest military expenditures in the post-Soviet region. These are also all countries that are directly involved in active military conflicts with each other due to regional disputes (Armenia-Azerbaijan -- Nagorno Karabakh; Russia-Ukraine -- Crimea).  

IV) The low freedom-low military spend quadrant is made up of the USSR's Central Asian countries Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, as well as Belarus and Moldova in Eastern Europe. At the time of this data, these countries were politically neutral in relations and/or in economic trade unions with Russia. 


Correlation Analysis:
While the data is limited, there is a weak linear correlation when looking at the two quadrants of low military spend (I & IV). In these countries, Human Freedom increases as military expenditure decreases. Tied back with insights from the quadrant chart, this correlation indicates that the quadrants might have distinct patterns.

Overall, the findings in this project were surprising. With knowledge on the geopolitical dynamics of the post-Soviet space, the way the countries mapped out in relation to each other is fascinating as it is broken up into countries ‘with conflict’ and ‘without’ at first glance. Digging deeper with more data (such as more years or a third variable) might be the next step to see how conflict affects human freedom.
